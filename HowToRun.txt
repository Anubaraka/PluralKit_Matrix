To run this you should go to https://nodejs.org/en and install node.js 22.0 or later.
One node is installed do the following:
1. delete the bot.js file and the entire crypto folder. This is so the bot doesn't have a conflict and dies.
2. open a command prompt in the same folder as the code
3. type in node start.js
4. copy the access token. It should look something like this: access_token: 'mct_YKjS2szLJvBhBt2QSZCUlkAGpEfaPl_4dWpj3'
5. open up index.js
6. paste the token on line 14 between the 2 quotation marks. The result should look something like const accessToken = "mct_YKjS2szLJvBhBt2QSZCUlkAGpEfaPl_4dWpj3";
7. type in node index.js

After following the 7 steps the bot should be running and automatically accept any room requests
the commands are:
!member add *member name* *member prefix*  - add a alter to the bot
!member remove *member namme*              - remove an alter from the bot
!member list                               - see a list of all the alters the bot is keeping track of
*member prefix* message you want to send   - speak as one of the alters that the bot is keeping track of

This version is very bad and the alters don't have an owner so anyone can use any alter. I will maybe come back to this, but it's a pain in the ass right now and i'm writing this at 1 AM. Have fun!
