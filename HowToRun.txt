To run this you should go to https://nodejs.org/en and install node.js 22.0 or later.
One node is installed do the following:
1. run the start.bat. I configured it to automatically do all the tasks needed to run this. It will 

After following the 7 steps the bot should be running and automatically accept any room requests
the commands are:
!member add *member name* *member prefix*  - add a alter to the bot
!member remove *member namme*              - remove an alter from the bot
!member list                               - see a list of all the alters the bot is keeping track of
*member prefix* message you want to send   - speak as one of the alters that the bot is keeping track of

This version is very bad and the alters don't have an owner so anyone can use any alter. I will maybe come back to this, but it's a pain in the ass right now and i'm writing this at 1 AM. Have fun!
